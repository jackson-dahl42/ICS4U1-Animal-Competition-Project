This repository is for a highschool computer science project. The name of the project is “Animal Competition” The game makes two animals fight each other until one enemy runs out of hit points. The program was made using C# and an online IDE called Replit. To configure the game go on replit.com or another IDE that can use C# or the .NET framework and clone the repository. From there you can run the program or modify the code to add new features or animals.
